1.	Read a CSV file (as part of the class path) at application startup, store each record(Employee record) in an in-memory cache solution (choose any caching solution that u are comfortable with). Each CSV record is an employee record, with below columns:

EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Title | BusinessUnit | Place | SupervisorID | Competencies | Salary
 
2.	Create a /employee/place/{place}/salary/{percentage} PUT endpoint that will update the in-memory cache by increasing their salary by percentage(percentage path param) for employees that have place matching with place path param.(Use java 8 for transformation)
 
3.	The end point will return the refreshed list of employee record

4.	Create a GET endpoint to return the nested list of all supervisees of a given supervisor e.g. consider D, C report into B, B report into A, if I query for A, I should get A->B->C,D

5.	Create an endpoint to return the total salary of 
a.	given BU
b.	given supervisor
c.	given place

6.	Create an endpoint to return the list of employees for a given place

7.	Create an endpoint to return the range of salaries for a given title

8.	Persist cache on shutdown so that last state is available on restart 
 
9.	The code must be modular/follow design principles(solid)
 
10.	It must have Swagger and Unit tests.
 
Please push your code to your PSCode once done.
